## Meet the penguins

![](images/lter_penguins.png){fig-alt="Three species of penguins." fig-align="center" style="float: right;" width="400"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

#|   Scatterplot of bill length vs. flipper length for three species of 
#|   penguins. The relationship is positive and moderately strong. The 
#|   three species are identified on the plot with points with different 
#|   colors and shapes, revealing three clusters.

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
