## Steps

### Demo 1 - Share / flexibility in formats:

- Open hello.Rmd with source editor -> knit
- Change to visual editor -> knit
- Close file -> change file type to .qmd -> open (make sure visual editor) and render
- Change `output: html_document` to `format: html` -> render
- Click on Render on save
- Change to `format: pdf` -> save to render -> then change back to `format: html`
- Add chunk option `echo: false` to the first chunk using tab completion -> save to render
- Delete `echo: false` from first chunk -> turn off echo from document YAML -- type `execute:`, return, `e`, tab completion to choose `echo` and `false`.

  ``` yaml
  execute:
      echo: false
  ```

- Add alt text to figure in second code chunk -> save to render

  ``` r
  #| fig-alt: |
  #|   Scatterplot of bill length vs. flipper length for three species of 
  #|   penguins. The relationship is positive and moderately strong. The three 
  #|   species are identified on the plot with points with different colors 
  #|   and shapes, revealing three clusters.
  ```

- Add image: 
  
  - using the visual editor, `images/lter_penguins.png`
  - add alt text: Three species of penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie.
  - close dialogue -> save to render
  - double click on image and change width to 400, tab to change height
  - go to Attributes and under CSS classes add `float: right;` -> save to render
  - switch over to source editor to show how this info is recorded

- Add tables:

  - Before "The plot below"
  - Insert H2: "Datasets"
  - Insert text: "This package has two datasets:"
  - Insert tabsets:
    - tab 1: penguins_raw
      - Includes nesting observations, penguin size data, and isotope measurements from blood samples for adult AdÃ©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.
    - tab 2: penguins
      - Subset of `penguins_raw`, includes measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

- Add H2 before plot "A first look at penguins"
- Change to `format: revealjs` -> save to render
- Remove execute / echo to show they're off by default -> save to render
- Add a slide with two columns
- Add code line highlighting to plotting chunk

  ``` r	
	#| code-line-numbers: "|3|5|7-12"
  ```

- Show hamburger menu outline and print to PDF
- Add chalkboard
  
  ``` yaml
  format: 
    revealjs:
      chalkboard: true
  ```

- Make into website by adding `_quarto.yml`

  ``` yaml
    project:
    type: website
  
  website:
    title: "Hello, Quarto!"
    navbar:
      left:
        - href: hello.qmd

  format:
    html:
      theme: cosmo
      toc: true
  ```
