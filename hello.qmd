The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Data sets

This package has two datasets.

::: panel-tabset
## `penguins_raw`

Includes nesting observations, penguin size data, and isotope measurements from blood samples for adult Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

```{r}
glimpse(penguins_raw)
```

## `penguins`

Subset of penguins_raw, includes measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)

## A first look at penguins

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

#|   Scatterplot of bill length vs. flipper length for three 
#|   species of penguins. The relationship is positive and 
#|   moderately strong. The three species are identified on 
#|   the plot with points with different colors and shapes, 
#|   revealing three clusters.

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
